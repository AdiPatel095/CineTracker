# CineTracker

CineTracker is a full-stack web application designed for movie and TV show enthusiasts who want to keep track of what they’ve watched and what they plan to watch. The platform allows users to search for movies and TV shows using the OMDb API, add titles to their personal library, and categorize them based on viewing status.

The goal of CineTracker is to provide an interactive and user-friendly experience for managing entertainment choices while implementing authentication to ensure personalized libraries for each user. Built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js), the application features a robust back-end with secure authentication using JWT, a dynamic front-end with React, and a Sequelize ORM database integration for persistent storage.
